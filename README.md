# Command-Line-File-Reader
This is a part of a challenge to build your own version of the Unix command line tool wc!
 

Type xxwc -c {your file name}.txt to count the number of bytes in your specified file  

Type xxwc -l {your file name}.txt to count the number of lines in your specified file   

Type xxwc -w {your file name}.txt to count the number of words in your specified file  

Type xxwc -m {your file name}.txt to count the number of characters in your specified file  

Type xxwc    {your file name}.txt for the default option - i.e. no options are provided, which is the equivalent to the -c, -l and -w options.
