# Command-Line-File-Reader
This is a part of a challenge to build your own version of the Unix command line tool wc!



Be sure to check it out by first down loading the files and then setting the location of these files as your enviornment variables in your pc   

Type xxwc -c {your file name}.txt to count the number of bytes in your specified file  

Type xxwc -l {your file name}.txt to count the number of lines in your specified file   

Type xxwc -w {your file name}.txt to count the number of words in your specified file  

Type xxwc -m {your file name}.txt to count the number of characters in your specified file  

Type xxwc    {your file name}.txt for the default option - i.e. no options are provided, which is the equivalent to the -c, -l and -w options.
